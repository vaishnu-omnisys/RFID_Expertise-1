RFID System Design & Implementation 
You're deploying an RFID system in a warehouse with 50,000 SKUs on metal shelving units containing liquids and metals. 

Design the complete system: 
Which frequency would you choose and why? 
How would you handle the metal/liquid interference? 
Calculate the number of readers needed for 10,000 sq ft
Determine antenna placement strategy
Explain your approach to anti-collision when 200+ tags might be in a reader's field simultaneously. 
What middleware filtering would you implement?
